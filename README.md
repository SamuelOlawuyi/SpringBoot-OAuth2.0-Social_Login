# Social Authentication with Spring Boot 3.0, OAuth2.0, and Social Logins (GitHub, Facebook, Google)

# About
Welcome to our advanced Modern Authentication with Spring Boot 3.0, OAuth2.0, and Social Logins repository! This project aims to simplify and optimize the essential process of user authentication, leveraging the features of Spring Boot 3.0, and integrating it with the efficient OAuth2.0 protocol.

We've come a long way to ensure a seamless login experience for users, utilizing well-known social login providers like GitHub, Facebook, and Google. It's all about combining convenience with security.

The functionality scope of this project involves creating a dynamic, single-page application that will offer users a choice of authentication providers, making the login process highly flexible and user-friendly. Each step in the project adds new aspects, from a straightforward, single-provider sign-on, to a client incorporating multiple authentication providers.

In addition, special focus has been given to handling various scenarios such as displaying customized error messages for unauthenticated users and implementing bespoke GitHub-based authentication.

By making the best use of the automatic configuration feature in Spring Boot, along with consistent code quality verification through code reviews, we are striving to make this project a go-to resource for modern authentication practices.
